   <p>
        My name is Holden Caulfield. I'm 16 and I used to go to Pencey Prep, but everyone there is fake. I got kicked out because I failed all but one of my classes and now I’m kicking around New York because I don’t want my parents to know I got kicked out. I don’t really have that many hobbies except for going to the bar and smoking. I have 3 siblings, D.B. who moved to Hollywood, Phoebe, my sister who’s really smart, and Allie, my brother that’s dead. Allie was always so innocent, and I strive to be like him every day. Sometimes I wish I could go back in time to say some things I’d wish I’d said to him, but he’s gone now. I’m here in New York city thinking about calling Jane and Phoebe, but I’m too afraid that my parents or Jane’s parents will pick up and then they’ll know I got kicked out of school.</p>

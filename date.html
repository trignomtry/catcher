   <p>I called up my old friend Sally Hayes and we talked for a while and I somehow convinced her to go to a movie with me. I packed my stuff up from the hotel to get away from the elevator guy, and I didn’t want to go to another hotel to get into another fight. I went to the train station near the movie theater where my date with Sally was and locked my bag up. I was eating at this restaurant when these nuns came up and sat next to me. They had their bags with them and obviously didn’t know they could put them in a lock box while they wait for their trains so I put them away for them. The suitcases looked cheap, but I didn’t care because they ended up being nice people. One was an English teacher and one was a history teacher.  You know how English is my best subject, I love English and we got to talking about some classic literature. I felt weird talking to them about Romeo and Juliet because of all of the stuff in it that they probably didn’t like. I told her my opinions on Romeo, Juliet and some of the other characters in the book, but just as I thought, she didn’t want to keep talking about it though and changed the subject to school. I told her I went to Pencey and she said it was a very good school. Yeah right. At least they didn’t ask if I was Catholic, those Catholics always do that. They like other Catholics more than anyone else. I was just having a conversation with someone at school about tennis and sports in general, and he changed the subject and asked if I was Catholic. I’m glad those nuns didn’t do that though, because we had a very nice conversation.

     Phoebe is my sister, and she’s a great person. She’s so smart and nice and she listens to people, she writes books and knows when movies are good and bad.  I really want to call her but I can’t because if my parents pick up, even if I don’t say anything they’ll know. My Mom always does. She just knows things and I don’t know how she does. Anyway I was bored so I went down to the lobby and heard the music playing in the Lavender room so I went in. I got put in one of those crappy tables that if you wanted to get in and out the people that were sitting next to you had to move. It wasn’t even that crowded, what the heck? I see these girls sitting at the table next to me and two of them are absolutely chopped, but one looks fine. I asked for my usual Scotch and Coke but the bartender said he needed identification. So I go up to this girl  and ask for a dance. She isn’t a bad dancer, but you should see Phoebe, she’s an incredible dancer. Better than the professionals you see. She says she saw some famous person getting the news and won’t hold a conversation with me. She just kept looking around like a celebrity would walk in at any moment. When I went to sit back down with them they were all just looking around for celebrities the whole time. When I danced with one of the ugly ones, I told her another celebrity had just walked in and out, and she believed me and thought that she saw him for a second too. She told the other two that she saw him and they started looking too. I kind of felt bad for them.</p>

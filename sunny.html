   <p>"You better sit down for this one, because it’s a crazy story. I’m walking back to the hotel from old Ernie’s, right, and I get there and go into the elevator. The elevator guy asks me how old I was. I was tired of all these people asking me this question, but I told him I was twenty two. He basically asked me if I wanted him to send a (insert Sunny’s profession here) up to my room. It was $5 so I figured why not and told him my room number. I washed my face and hair, brushed my teeth and put on a clean shirt, I didn’t really know what to do because I’ve never done this before. About 15 minutes later this young girl, I think she was about my age, came up. I started to talk to her but she wasn’t having it. She wouldn’t answer any of my questions and kept asking if I knew the time. She finally introduced herself, her name was Sunny. But when she started talking about stuff like her dress it got me all depressed and I wasn’t in the mood anymore. I just started lying to her about how I had just had a surgery and crap, but she wasn’t having it and got really angry, even though I said I’d still pay her! Then she tried to lie saying that I owed her $10 instead of $5! I paid her five and then she got all angry again. I was thinking about it later and realized how nervous she was for someone who does this kind of stuff. And how she said “Like fun you are.” It made her sound really young, on top of how young she looked. It all made me really depressed. Later the old elevator guy and Sunny came knocking on my door and came asking where the rest of his ten dollars was. I told him that he only told me it was five, and he told me he’d beat me up. I stood tall but he just held me down while Sunny stole the other five out of my wallet. That made me even more depressed. "</p>
